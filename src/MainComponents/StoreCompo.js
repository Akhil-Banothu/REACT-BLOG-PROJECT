         description: "Minecraft, the 3D sandbox video game that lets you create and destroy blocks in a virtual world, has just reached a staggering 300 million copies sold worldwide. That's more than any other single game in history, including Grand Theft Auto V, which has sold 'only' 185 million copies as of August 2023. The only franchise that can rival Minecraft is Super Mario, which has sold over 800 million games across its multiple titles. But Minecraft is unique in that it's playable on almost any platform you can think of.",
         description2: "The world of Minecraft is so vast that it dwarfs our own planet. The potential map size of Minecraft is about 60,000 km by 60,000 km, which is roughly four times the surface area of Earth. That means you can walk for days and days without ever reaching the edge of the world. And if you think that's impressive, wait until you hear this: there's a project called Build the Earth that aims to recreate the entire Earth in Minecraft.Using satellite data and a lot of dedication, the project hopes to replicate every natural and man- made feature on our planet, from the Grand Canyon to the Eiffel Tower.",
         description3: "Minecraft's creator, Markus Persson, also known as Notch, has a special avatar in the game. When he dies, he drops an apple. He's the only player in the game who has this unique feature. The apple is also a very powerful item in the game, known as an Enchanted Apple or a Notch Apple. It gives you several buffs, such as regeneration, fire resistance and absorption.",

         description: "Samsung's S series continues to dominate the world of Android flagships, with a premium price tag to match. But not everyone can afford to splurge on the latest and greatest Galaxy phone, even if they love Samsung's ecosystem of devices. That's why Samsung offers the Fan Edition lineup of smartphones that offer many of the same features and benefits but at a much more reasonable cost. The specs are so good on paper, in fact, that it made us question whether buying the Galaxy S23 is even worth it.We're talking about the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE, of course, and here are some reasons why we think the phone challenges the need for flagship spending.",
         description2: "The Galaxy S23 FE is a close cousin of the Galaxy S23 and Galaxy S23+, sharing the same triple camera setup at the back that gives it a distinctive 'Samsung' look that you can recognise from a mile away. Samsung calls it the “floating camera” design and it's very sleek and simple, with no unnecessary camera specs printed on the back of the phone. This design is now common across all Samsung phones, but the Galaxy S23 FE has something extra: a Gorilla Glass 5 back. This, along with the aluminium frame, makes the phone feel solid and premium in the hand.",
         description3: "But while the phone looks and feels premium, it is not very comfortable to hold. The aluminium frame has a slight curve, but it does not merge smoothly with the glass on both sides. The edges are sharp and they dig into your palm, which can get irritating after some time. You will need a case if you like to use your phone for long hours. This was not an issue with the Galaxy S series as far as I remember, so it seems that Samsung has deliberately tried to create some difference between the series in terms of in-hand comfort. On the front, you can see more signs of cost-cutting - the Galaxy S23 FE's display has thick bezels all around. In fact, they are thicker than its predecessor (Galaxy S21 FE). They are not too annoying, but they are still quite noticeable compared to what other phones offer at this price.",

         description: "AI chatbots are becoming more popular and powerful, thanks to advances in natural language processing and deep learning. They can help us with various tasks, such as booking flights, ordering food, or answering questions. However, they are not perfect. Sometimes, they can produce responses that are inaccurate, irrelevant, or even nonsensical. This is called “hallucination”, and it happens when the AI model generates something that is not based on reality or logic. Hallucination can be a serious problem, especially when we rely on AI chatbots for important decisions or information.Imagine if you asked it for financial tips, and it suggested you to invest in a Ponzi scheme.Or if you asked it for historical facts, and it made up some events that never happened.",
         description2: "One of the main causes of hallucination is ambiguity. When you use complex or vague prompts, the AI model may not understand what you want or what you mean. It may try to guess or fill in the gaps, resulting in inaccurate or irrelevant responses. To avoid this, you should use simple, direct language when you communicate with AI chatbots. Make sure your prompts are clear, concise, and easy to understand. Avoid using jargon, slang, idioms, or metaphors that may confuse the AI model.",
         description3: "Sometimes, AI can make up stuff when it does not have a clear sense of its identity or purpose. It may try to imitate human behaviour or personality, which can lead to errors or inconsistencies. It may also try to 'impress' you by making up things that are not true or realistic. To prevent this, you should give the AI a specific role - and tell it not to lie.A role defines what the AI model is supposed to do or be, such as a teacher, a friend, a doctor, or a journalist.A role also sets some expectations and boundaries for the AI model's behaviour and responses.",

Nothing is one of them, with its Ear series of earbuds that feature a transparent body and a distinctive form factor. The brand has a flair for design, which is also evident in its subbrand CMF's latest product. The CMF Buds Pro are among the most quirky and fancy earbuds we have ever seen, but they have more to offer than just looks.Read on to find out why we are impressed by them.",
         description2: "CMF sure was pretty serious about its whole “colour, material, and finish” mojo with the Buds Pro because the earbuds check all these boxes - well, almost if you dig the black colour that I was lent. These earbuds also come in white (which instantly caught my eye when I saw the promotional images) and bright orange for those who like to make a statement. I especially liked the shape and size of the case, which has a circular design that resembles a makeup product, like a blush compact.",
         description3: "One thing that these earbuds nail is the matte finish they sport. It's not easy to pull off when the choice of materials is low-quality and only makes things worse. But CMF has done a good job here. The earbuds also feel premium thanks to the weight of the case and its thickness. The lid, for example, has a nice heft to it and closes with a satisfying and loud click. However, the downside of the black colour and the matte finish is that these earbuds are prone to scratches. In fact, I could easily scratch them with my fingernails. That's why I would suggest opting for the white or orange colours instead.",

The Galaxy Z Fold, which is widely considered the best foldable phone available, now faces a serious contender: the OnePlus Open. How do these two devices compare, and which one is worth the money? Let's find out.",
         description2: "The Galaxy Z Fold 5 may have a fancy form factor, but it doesn't go overboard with its design. It has a sleek and minimal look that suits its professional appeal. The back of the phone features a neat triple camera setup that is unmistakably Samsung, and the device has a rather slim profile when shut - it almost feels like holding a TV remote. The OnePlus Open, on the other hand, has a more flashy design accentuated by the massive disc-shaped camera module on the back. OnePlus has also played around with different materials for this device, giving the black variant a leather back.",
         description3: "When it comes to weight and thickness, both devices are pretty similar, though the Open has a slight edge over the Fold. The OnePlus phone weighs 239 grams, which is a bit lighter than the Galaxy Z Fold 5's 253 grams. OnePlus made a big deal about this at its launch event, showing how its phone is actually lighter than the iPhone 14 Pro Max. The Open is also thinner at 5.8mm vs the 6.1mm of the Galaxy Z Fold 5, though this difference shouldn't be that noticeable. The real difference lies in the displays. Many people have complained about how narrow the Galaxy Z Fold 5's 6.2-inch cover display is. Meanwhile, the OnePlus Open has a more conventional 20:9 6.31-inch cover display that almost looks like a regular smartphone when folded.",

When I purchased my first-ever set of TWS earbuds and ditched my perfectly working original OnePlus Bullets Z, I was quite excited to be untethered from annoying wires for the first time and finally be able to turn my head around freely. The euphoria was short-lived though - I lost one of the earbuds at a party just a few months later - a common mishap among TWS earbuds users.",
         description2: "There's no forgiving my carelessness, but this unfortunate experience did make me question if shelling out several thousand rupees on something so easy to lose was truly worth it for people like me. I shrugged off that thought and got myself another set of earbuds. But that nagging doubt stayed with me until OnePlus sent me their latest neckband - the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC - for review. Now that I have them, I am very tempted to stick with them.",
         description3: "If I recall it right, the Bullets Z2 ANC seem to have inherited their looks from their predecessors, which is not a bad thing at all. They are sleek and stylish earphones with a matte finish that feels smooth to the touch. The cables are not braided, but they have a nice texture that gives them a premium feel over ordinary wires. Now let me tell you the first advantage of neckband earphones. They just fit better. Maybe it's because TWS earbuds are a bit too heavy and keep dragging themselves down and out - whatever the reason, these neckbands stay put. And even in the slim chance they do slip out, there's no need to panic. They are hanging around your neck and won't go anywhere unless into aerobics or someone pulls a snatch and dash on those.",

This device has a 7-inch 1080p 120Hz display and is notably lighter and smaller than the Steam Deck (more on it later).

Starlink aims to offer broadband service that is faster, cheaper, and more reliable than existing options, especially in rural and remote areas where connectivity is limited or nonexistent.",

Each satellite uses four phased array antennas and two parabolic antennas to provide increased capacity. To use Starlink, you need a Starlink kit that includes a Starlink dish, a WiFi router/power supply, cables, and a base. The dish is self-orienting and connects quickly as long as it has a clear view of the sky. You can use the Starlink app to manage your service and check your signal strength.",

Instead, four technicians who walked off their jobs on Oct. 27 said, they have been subjected to what they described as a “typical U.S.model”: six- day workweeks, unavoidable overtime and an unclear evaluation system for promotion.",

The union representing the Tesla workers, IF Metall, won't say how many of the company's 130 technicians have walked out — it may be only a few dozen.The company's 10 service centers remain open. But as the strike moves into its third month, it is having an outsize impact on the Nordic region. At least 15 other unions have taken action to try to force Tesla to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement to set wages and benefits that reflect industrywide norms in Sweden. Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, warned that the dispute was becoming “an important lightning-rod issue around unions globally” for Tesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk.",
         description3: "Polls show a majority of Swedes support the strike, widely viewed as a defense of the country's consensus-based way of doing business. Nine in 10 people in Sweden work under a labor agreement, and strikes are relatively rare. But as the walkout continues, questions are being raised about whether Sweden's reliance on labor-management agreements denies businesses flexibility and agility. That divide can be seen in the reactions of some of the country's roughly 50,000 Tesla owners, who see the walkout as a power play by a wealthy, politically influential union. Mr. Musk has pushed back against efforts by his 127,000 employees around the world to unionize. The company has declined repeated requests for comment.At a service center in Malmo this month, workers wearing Tesla shirts were busy moving cars in and out.Strikers on the picket line said some of those working appeared to be recent hires",

The factory's other 1,074 robots were made in Shanghai. Volkswagen used to import shock absorbers from Central Europe for cars it makes at Chinese factories.Now it buys them from a company in China for 40 percent less. After relying for decades on engineers in Germany to design cars for the Chinese market, Volkswagen has begun hiring for a team of nearly 3,000 Chinese engineers, which will include hundreds transferred from Volkswagen operations elsewhere in China.They will design electric cars at VW's industrial complex in Hefei, a city in central China.",
         description2: "The new strategy, which Volkswagen calls “In China, for China,” is another sign of how China's commanding lead in electric vehicles has upended global auto making. Chinese car brands are appearing more in Germany and throughout Europe, causing politicians to worry about job losses. But Volkswagen is doubling down on its business in China, which is the world's largest car market and also Volkswagen's biggest market. VW's aim is to match the speed and efficiency of Chinese electric car manufacturers, which have seized a rapidly growing share of the Chinese car market. That has caused sales of the German car maker's gasoline-powered vehicles to plunge in China. China's city governments and state- controlled banks have been pouring money into electric car makers, helping them build new factories faster than their sales have grown.",

Volkswagen wants low costs to make sure its electric cars can be priced competitively. So it plans to start production in Hefei in the coming weeks of its new Tavascan sport utility vehicle for sale in China and export to Europe. “We all know how difficult it is to make money on electric cars,” said Ralf Brandstätter, the chairman and chief executive of VW's overall China operations. The need to reduce costs is so great that it has also meant painful cuts in Germany — a difficult choice for a company that has been a pillar of German industry since the 1930s.The German state of Lower Saxony owns nearly 12 percent of the company.European labor leaders hold nearly half the seats on the company's supervisory board.",

In August, the Bob Bakish- led studio conglomerate took down its “for sale” sign on the unit — which includes the BET channel, streamer BET + as well as VH1 and BET Studios — after gauging interest from several suitors.A few moguls including Perry, Sean “Diddy Combs” and Byron Allen, who owns a number of local TV stations as well as The Weather Channel and other assets via his Entertainment Studios firm, had expressed interest in acquiring the stake.",
         description2: "On Wednesday, during a Bloomberg Equality Summit in Atlanta, Perry gave a glimpse at how that process went for those aiming to acquire the stake. “I was disappointed about it for a number of reasons,” he said as reported by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “The way it happened was disrespectful in a lot of ways.” Though Perry didn't share many details on what all happened, he added, “Don't try to get me to pay for something that's not worth anywhere near the value” Paramount claimed it was. When asked if he would reconsider if Paramount placed BET up for sale again, he said, “No.”",
         description3: "At this time, Perry still has a minority stake in the BET+ streaming service and provides content to Paramount programs, including BET and Nickelodeon through a multiyear content partnership inked in 2019. The mogul is also a major player in the production space via his Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta.“God bless them,” he added of Paramount. “I'm still working with them.I wish them the best.” If a deal was closed, Paramount would have expected to maintain a minority stake in the business.The sale would have also given the company more cash to focus on its main streaming service, Paramount +, which currently has 61 million global subscribers.The company has looked to shed assets — including book publisher Simon & Schuster — to focus on its core entertainment portfolio.",

During a recent discussion at a City University of New York event, the Oppenheimer filmmaker noted how the pop star bypassed studios and teamed directly with AMC Theatres to bring her movie to the big screen. Nolan spoke alongside his Oppenheimer producing partner and wife, Emma Thomas, who said that studios have been too skittish about releasing movies in the streaming era.",

And if they don't want it, somebody else will. So that's just the truth of it.”",
         description3: "As for his own record-breaking blockbuster, Oppenheimer, which debuted on one of the biggest box office weekends ever with Barbie, Nolan has his own take on the complicated theatrical business and where it's headed. “Any time a film succeeds that isn't expected to succeed, it's an encouraging thing for Hollywood.… It's encouraging for filmmakers,” Nolan explained. “There's always the tension in Hollywood between the familiar and what is predicted to make money, and that's the meat and potatoes of how the studios stay in business, but there's always this desire[among] audiences for something new, something fresh.”",

I'm like, 'What are you talking about?' And he was like, 'My brother's was original and this is like, eh.' He really respected it, but you could see how tough he was.

We had a gym in the parking lot, and we'd all be lifting weights on set all day,” explained actor Joe Manganiello, about performing in the film Magic Mike. It is not unusual for actors to undergo drastic changes in preparation for a role, including gaining muscle and losing body fat for that shredded look.In fact, this is becoming the norm in Hollywood. Jake Gyllenhaal in Road House, Michelle Rodriguez in Dungeons & Dragons, and Paul Rudd in Ant - Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, have all undertaken body modifications for roles this year. As the audience, we readily accept these body modifications to be part of the preparation for the role without necessarily considering the potentially long - term physical and mental health consequences",
         description2: "From what Hollywood shares with the general public about these body modifications, which is generally very limited, it appears these transformations occur through excessive exercise and highly restrictive diets. Nevertheless, these Hollywood workouts are highly popular with ordinary people, with Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Chris Hemsworth's workouts particularly sought after. These regimens resemble those of competitive bodybuilders, whose success also relies on appearance. The typical process for bodybuilders involves two phases: a “bulking” phase, during which the goal is to have enough energy for muscle growth, and a “cutting” phase, when the aim is to lose weight but not muscle. The end result of such a process is usually highly applauded, even though drastic measures have been taken to achieve such a look.",

So, I'd prefer not to die,” said Christian Bale, who has undertaken multiple extreme transformations for roles. To achieve what is needed for a particular role, extreme measures are often taken.However, the consequences of these measures, such as use of substances, exercise dependence, and an increased risk of developing muscle dysmorphia and/ or an eating disorder, is seemingly not common knowledge. A concern for the bodybuilding community is the widespread use of drugs, often multiple drugs at a time not obtained through prescription.Androgenic - anabolic steroids are commonly used which can have extensive negative effects on the human body, including on the cardiovascular system, hormones, metabolism and even psychiatric wellbeing.",

The quirky and expansive sci- fi action film is famed for its absurdist take on the idea of a multiverse, yet it is still grounded in realness and humanity: In one masterfully choreographed scene in Everything Everywhere, three languages are spoken by three generations of one chaotic immigrant family over dinner. As a linguist, I am interested in how screenwriters and directors use language in film to do much more than just convey dialogue: Language and subtitles also provide characterization, establish the tone of a scene and ground fictional stories in reality.",
         description2: " Increasing use of non - English languages and subtitles demonstrates both a trend toward linguistic realism in Hollywood and also broader acceptance of linguistic diversity in a globalized society. But filmmakers must negotiate the tension between narrative goals and audience engagement. By examining different ideologies held by filmmakers and audiences alike, we can also still sometimes find long-standing associations between foreign language and villainy. As South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho described in his Golden Globes acceptance speech for 2019's Parasite, when audiences move past the “one-inch tall barrier of subtitles” a richer world of film awaits.",
         description3: "Telling authentic stories in a modern, globalized and multicultural world means fairly portraying the languages spoken and signed all throughout our society.Hence, at times, the need for subtitles. In another scene in Everything Everywhere, spoken language is eschewed altogether: Two rocks converse silently while gazing over a barren canyon, with black and white subtitles appearing on a bright blue sky. This simple yet emotionally resonant scene was somehow enough to move many viewers to tears. Although Todd Field's Tár did not clinch any Oscar wins this year, star Cate Blanchett notched multiple other acting awards for her role as the titular orchestra conductor.In some of the film's best scenes, the maestro uses only German during orchestra rehearsals and subtitles are dropped completely.",

And why are you doing it now? “One of the biggest parts of sticking to any training plan is knowing why you're doing it,” says Kourtney Thomas, CSCS, a St.Louis-based Road Runners Club of America(RRCA)-certified running coach and trainer. “Figure out why it matters to you, and what you hope to achieve from it, and that will help you feel connected to the effort in a deeper way.”",
         description3: "One technique that can help beginner runners is run-walk intervals. To do it, pick an easy pace for a run — easy is being able to talk as you're running — for a certain amount of time (start with a minute), and then walk for that same amount of time. Then repeat the pattern. That way, your body can get used to the motion of running without tiring as quickly. As the running portions of the interval get easier, increase the minute of running to two minutes. When that feels easier, add another minute to the run portion of the interval, and so on until you're able to take out the walking all together.",

Even if you have just a few minutes, doing one or two exercises can still bring benefits. Such “exercise snacks” can break up long stretches of sitting, boost energy, and may even improve long-term health. More movement throughout the day tends to be good movement, says Emmanuel Stamatakis, PhD, professor of physical activity, lifestyle, and population health at the University of Sydney in Australia.",
         description2: "A study in Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism looked at the effect of “exercise snacks,” or short-duration, high-intensity activities. For this study, researchers asked a group of young adults (who all reported getting less than one hour of physical activity per week at the start of the study) to go up a flight of stairs quickly three times per day, three days a week for six weeks. They found that just that amount of effort improved cardiorespiratory fitness.",
         description3: "Dr. Stamatakis coauthored an editorial in the British Journal of Sports Medicine outlining the many studies that show sporadic, incidental physical activity benefits health (and praising the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans for dropping the previous requirement that physical activity should be done in bouts of 10 minutes or more to count toward weekly requirements). The bottom line is that if you don't have a chunk of time to devote to a 30-minute, 45-minute, or longer workout, it's still worth getting a little sweat on. But what type of movement should you do to maximize that “exercise snack” time?",

Don't Hold the pit- laden avocado half in one hand and use a large knife to whack into the pit so you can lift it out.Many people use this method, but swinging a big, sharp knife with force and speed toward your palm is never a good idea, Swartz says.In fact, there were an estimated 8, 900 avocado - related emergency room visits in one year alone, according to an Insider article.",

Don't Set the carrot down and start cutting it into rounds because that increases the chances of the slices rolling away.

Any pedaling you do on that bike, whether it's a few loops around the block or a century ride, counts as physical activity. But what makes a bike ride an intense or easy workout for you, of course, depends on your fitness level. This type of activity does build strength, particularly in the lower- body muscles like the quadriceps — but it's primarily an aerobic exercise, according to Milwaukee-based Paul Warloski, USA Cycling-certified cycling coach and ACE-certified personal trainer.

There isn't much difference in performance or benefits with an outdoor bike versus a stationary bike, he adds. For some, staying indoors can be a more convenient way to exercise — you don't have to worry about navigating different routes, for example, or making sure you have water, snacks, and repair kit handy (meaning you may be able to get a more intense workout in less time).",

There's nothing like riding outside and connecting with your surroundings, Warloski says. Add a fun group, a good place to stop and rest, and you've got an amazing day out.

Generally, says Vavrek, a snack with quick - digesting carbs like a banana or a bagel works well, provided you had a regular meal about four hours beforehand.If you're running first thing in the morning, just the snack is probably enough. “It really is variable, because some people can eat a huge meal right before a run and they're fine, while others definitely can't do that,” she adds. “Keeping a log of what you eat and how you felt on your run is the best way to figure it out for yourself.”",

In very severe cases, too much caffeine can cause hallucinations, psychosis, seizure and arrhythmias.",
         description2: "So how much is too much? The amount of caffeine in 20 fluid ounces, or about two and half cups, of coffee is about 250 milligrams, which is considered moderate or “average.” If you consume more than this on a regular basis, you may want to consider cutting back. Caffeine is mildly addictive; withdrawal symptoms can include headaches and fatigue. Too much caffeine can also stand in the way of calcium absorption and may interfere with some medications.According to current research data, doses of up to 400 milligrams are considered safe for the average adult.Women that are pregnant or may become pregnant should keep their intake limited to 200 milligrams.",
         description3: "There is some evidence to support that moderate coffee drinking may reduce your risk of developing dementia and Parkinson's disease and can enhance mental and physical performance - but again, this is dose dependent, and tolerance can vary from person to person. While there may be some benefits to consuming caffeine, having more than the recommended amount can have an adverse effect.Caffeine - containing foods and drinks like tea, coffee and chocolate also contain cell - protecting antioxidants in varying quantities.",

Protein-rich foods provide energy, and contain essential amino acids that you can only get from your diet. Having a steady intake of these essential amino acids daily is key to maintaining health.",

Outside of these requirements, growing children and adolescents, pregnant women and active athletes often require more. To support needs for growth and exercise, protein needs may range from 1.2 to 1.8 grams per kilogram (82 to 123 grams) for the same 150-pound person. Get your protein from healthy animal-based options like lean meats, fish, low-fat dairy and eggs. Balance your intake with plant-based proteins like soy, legumes, nuts and seeds.",
         description3: "Time for some math! If one kilogram is equal to 2.2 pounds, then the one gram per pound recommendation is 2.2 grams per kilogram - far beyond the 1.2 to 1.8 grams target mentioned above. A dramatic increase in protein may not be harmful to healthy folks, but doses this extreme will not optimize nutrition. High-protein dieters often suffer from low-fiber intake as well as fatigue from a lack of easily digestible energy sources (a.k.a. carbohydrates).",

Further balance out a nutty snack by having something else along with it - a piece of fruit or low-fat yogurt are two great options.",

Chili or curry powder, garlic, cinnamon, cumin, salt, pepper, brown sugar, ground mustard or orange peel are just a few flavor boosters. To get the spices to stick to the nuts, use egg whites, butter, coconut oil, olive oil or blanch the nuts in boiling water. Some recipes call for nuts to be fried in oil prior to seasoning, but this adds unnecessary fat - you can make them just a delicious without all the extra calories. After a quick dip in the spices, pop in the oven to bake in the flavor.",
         description3: "As for which nuts, exactly, to throw into the mix, choose whatever you like - pick from almonds, pistachios, walnuts, pecans, cashews, macadamia nuts and more. Just be sure to start with raw or dry roasted, unsalted nuts so you can control the flavors. Use full sized nuts (or halves) instead of chopped pieces so they cook evenly.

Don't look only for perfectly round or red tomatoes. Oddly shaped, bizarre-colored heirloom and other unique varieties are some of the tastiest kinds!",

But if you can't finish all your ripe beauties at once, that's when the refrigeration-is-ok rule kicks in. Otherwise, they'll rot and that'll elicit the exact opposite emotion of joy. Store ripe tomatoes in the refrigerator somewhere where they will not be squished, like on the top shelf of the refrigerator, for up to five days, according to the USDA.Store them away from other produce that might be affected and spoiled by their ripening gas, such as lettuce and dark leafy greens.",
         description3: "It's also okay to refrigerate half a tomato or whatever is left from cutting into one. Just be sure to pack the remnant in an airtight container to prevent its picking up other fridge flavors.

Among her suggestions: Pick the ripest fruit, use whole-grain flour whenever possible, bake at a high temperature for more flavor and browning -- and reduce the sugar and add just a little more salt. People are scared to use salt, but it's a flavor enhancer, Nathan explains. You can halve the amount of sugar in most any recipe and just double the salt and it would taste so much brighter.",

So, what does this mean for your diet this flu season?",

Before we get into the nitty-gritty, it's important to note that this diet is not rooted in science, it goes against basic nutritional biochemistry and human evolution, and quite frankly, it may lead to the dangerous gateway to disordered eating. If you're looking for more information on a healthier way to combine food groups for optimal health, consult a registered dietitian.",
         description2: "ood Combining is the philosophy that separating certain macronutrients and food groups can help with digestion and assist with overall weight loss. The belief is that eating the “wrong combination” of foods, creates a buildup of disease-causing toxins and an increase in digestive stress. Proponents of Food Combining believe that the three macronutrients — protein, fats and carbs — take different times to digest and uniquely affect the pH level in the stomach, so they should not be eaten together. ",
         description3: "The fact is the stomach is a highly acidic environment (on purpose) in order to break down your food no matter what combination you eat it in and kill off any bacteria that could wreak havoc on your intestines. Once food passes through the stomach to the intestines, it enters a basic pH environment, and gets further broken down and either absorbed into your bloodstream or moved through your intestines until it leaves your body as stool. While all of this is occurring, your body is working hard to tightly regulate the pH in your stomach, your intestines, and your blood to keep your body functioning optimally. (In fact, if your blood falls out of a very narrow pH range of 7.35 to 7.45, you're probably pretty sick and belong in the ICU.)",

This year is going to look quite different.We won't have the freedom to safely mingle as we normally do. All get- togethers will require careful forethought, strategic planning, creativity and flexibility depending on our families' risk factors and where we are in the country. The CDC has released COVID-19 safety guidelines specific to the holidays this year, and director Robert Redfield recently warned governors that small household gatherings are an increasing threat.",

And although we've all been living with the risks for months, the holidays are not the time to ease up on our regular safety protocols. Over the holidays we tend to let our guards down, because we're on vacation or you're home and you want to be able to just chill, says Dr.Michelle Barron, MD, medical director of infection prevention and control at UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital.

Large indoor gatherings with people outside your household and gatherings involving alcohol are considered high risk activities by the CDC. Where alcohol is involved, that represents even more of a risk, because people's inhibitions get let down, and when people are drinking, they get louder, so they're expelling more viral particles, Dr.Poland says. Combine that with indoor low humidity, cooler weather, and the singing and frivolity of a holiday party, and you're asking for trouble.",
